¡Hola! I'm a late-twenties software engineer who comes from Spain, concretely from the beautiful Canary Islands. Currently, I work as Android developer at [SI Labs](http://www.si-labs.com) in Berlin.

This place was created after some years working as Android developer and my need to share thoughts about questions that appear in the daily business. Moreover, this not only is a place where you can find information and advices, but also is a place where we can discuss what I share with you. So, in the end, this is a place for both you and me to grow as developers :)

If you love Android, Java and you are quite organized and meticulous at work, you'll feel right at home here.

###### This blog stinks Material Design!

Yes, that's true. As Android developer, I am dealing with Material Design day by day, so I considered it would be a nice style to apply to my blog.

###### Any non-answered question?

Just follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PowerAndBrake) or check the Social item in the footer for more info.
